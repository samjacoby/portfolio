Hello, I'm a printer, publisher, and programmer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I studied computer science at Harvard. I'm interested in good code, printing, radios, tree frogs, and more besides. 
    
I'm a student in the [High-Low Tech Research Group](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu). 

This is a picture of me. I don't look like that at all.
